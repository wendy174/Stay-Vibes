# Stay Vibes
## About The Project
The inspiration behind this project was to recreate the renowned Airbnb app and leverage our skills in developing an application using React and Rails. This app provides a fun platform for renting and listing unique homes across the country. On the website, users will be able to:

* Sign up and create a profile
* View all listings and their associated reviews
* Delete their own reviews
* Save their favorite homes to a "favorites" page
* Edit their reviews

## Built With:
* React 
* Ruby on Rails 
* Bootstrap
* Chakra UI
* Postgres
